## Functional requirements
1. The user registers a trip by entering the destination, start date, end date, guests' e-mails and also their full name and e-mail address;
2. The trip creator receives an e-mail to confirm the new trip via a link. By clicking on the link, the trip is confirmed, the guests receive confirmation emails and the creator is redirected to the trip page;
3. The guests, by clicking on the attendance confirmation link, are redirected to the application where they must enter their name (in addition to the e-mail address that has already been filled in) and then they are confirmed on the trip;
4. On the event page, trip participants can add important trip links such as AirBnB booking, places to visit, etc...
5. Also on the event page, the creator and guests can add activities that will take place during the trip with a title, date and time;
6. New participants can be invited from within the event page via e-mail and so must go through the confirmation flow like any other guest
